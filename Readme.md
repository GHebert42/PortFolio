# Portfolio 
[One-Pager] (./docs/index.html)

Making my own website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
... Without template, or WebKit.

## One-Pager
I wanted to build my own web-page from scratch! 
Adding some SlideShow from my past work as a Portfolio became a challenge.

It will be better pretty soon!!! 
But for now, i ust say it works!

-   Try Me !!!
    - Not .

### In Fact ...
-   it seems that i misunderstand what's a resume for!!! 
> The one pager i did recently was my pride, because it challenged me to making it all by myself, my own hand... 
-  but to be honest, it isn't look that good ! =( 
   
> If i ask for an opinion, for other's perpective.
>> I must listen, i'll redo the process... 

- For sure i'll keep the last as an artifact...  [art] ...
